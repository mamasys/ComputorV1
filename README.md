# ComputorV1

ComputorV1 is a small C++ program that:

- **Reduces** a polynomial equation (reorganizes and simplifies terms).
- **Determines** the polynomial degree (from 0 to 3).
- **Solves** for \(X\) based on the determined degree:
  - **Degree 0**: checks consistency (no variable).
  - **Degree 1**: unique solution.
  - **Degree 2**: discriminant, two real solutions or one double, or complex.
